    "output": "Certainly! Here's a fully working Python code that demonstrates how to use the `corr` function from the pandas library to calculate the correlation matrix between numerical columns in a DataFrame:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame with numerical columns\ndata = {\n    'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n    'B': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],\n    'C': [100, 200, 300, 400, 500],\n    'D': [1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Calculate the correlation matrix\ncorrelation_matrix = df.corr()\n\n# Print the correlation matrix\nprint(\"Correlation Matrix:\")\nprint(correlation_matrix)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nCorrelation Matrix:\n          A         B         C         D\nA  1.000000  1.000000  1.000000  1.000000\nB  1.000000  1.000000  1.000000  1.000000\nC  1.000000  1.000000  1.000000  1.000000\nD  1.000000  1.000000  1.000000  1.000000\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. We start by importing the necessary libraries: `pandas` and `numpy`.\n\n2. We create a sample DataFrame called `df` with four numerical columns: 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. You can replace this with your own DataFrame containing numerical columns.\n\n3. We use the `corr()` function on the DataFrame `df` to calculate the correlation matrix between the numerical columns. The `corr()` function computes the pairwise correlation of columns, excluding missing values.\n\n4. Finally, we print the correlation matrix using `print(correlation_matrix)`.\n\nThe resulting correlation matrix shows the pairwise correlations between the columns. In this example, all the columns have a perfect positive correlation of 1.0 with each other because the sample data is linearly related.\n\nYou can apply this code to your own DataFrame by replacing the sample data with your actual data. The `corr()` function will calculate the correlation matrix for the numerical columns in your DataFrame."
