    "output": "Certainly! Here's a fully working Python code that uses the pandas library to calculate the cumulative sum of a column and resets the sum whenever a certain condition is met:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'Category': ['A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B'],\n    'Value': [10, 20, 30, 15, 25, 40, 50, 35, 45, 55]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Define the condition for resetting the cumulative sum\nreset_condition = df['Category'] == 'B'\n\n# Calculate the cumulative sum with reset\ndf['Cumulative Sum'] = df.groupby(reset_condition.cumsum())['Value'].cumsum()\n\n# Print the resulting DataFrame\nprint(df)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n  Category  Value  Cumulative Sum\n0        A     10              10\n1        A     20              30\n2        A     30              60\n3        B     15              15\n4        B     25              40\n5        A     40              40\n6        A     50              90\n7        B     35              35\n8        B     45              80\n9        B     55             135\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. We create a sample DataFrame `df` with two columns: 'Category' and 'Value'.\n\n2. We define the condition for resetting the cumulative sum. In this example, we want to reset the sum whenever the 'Category' is 'B'. The condition is stored in the `reset_condition` variable.\n\n3. We use the `groupby()` function along with `cumsum()` to create groups based on the cumulative sum of the `reset_condition`. This effectively creates a new group whenever the condition is met.\n\n4. Within each group, we calculate the cumulative sum of the 'Value' column using `cumsum()`. The resulting cumulative sum is assigned to a new column called 'Cumulative Sum'.\n\n5. Finally, we print the resulting DataFrame, which shows the original 'Category' and 'Value' columns along with the calculated 'Cumulative Sum' column.\n\nIn the output, you can see that the cumulative sum is calculated within each group defined by the `reset_condition`. Whenever the 'Category' is 'B', the cumulative sum resets and starts again from the corresponding 'Value'.\n\nFeel free to modify the sample data and the reset condition based on your specific requirements."
