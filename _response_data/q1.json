    "output": "Certainly! Here's a fully working Python code that demonstrates how to implement a custom aggregation function to calculate the weighted average of a column based on another column in a DataFrame using the pandas library:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef weighted_average(group):\n    values = group['value']\n    weights = group['weight']\n    return (values * weights).sum() / weights.sum()\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndata = {'category': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B'],\n        'value': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],\n        'weight': [0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Calculate the weighted average of 'value' based on 'weight' for each category\nresult = df.groupby('category').apply(weighted_average)\n\nprint(\"Original DataFrame:\")\nprint(df)\nprint(\"\\nWeighted Average:\")\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nOriginal DataFrame:\n  category  value  weight\n0        A     10     0.2\n1        A     20     0.3\n2        B     30     0.1\n3        B     40     0.2\n4        B     50     0.2\n\nWeighted Average:\ncategory\nA    16.0\nB    42.0\ndtype: float64\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. We define a custom function called `weighted_average` that takes a group of rows from the DataFrame as input. This function calculates the weighted average of the 'value' column based on the 'weight' column for each group.\n\n2. Inside the `weighted_average` function, we extract the 'value' and 'weight' columns from the group using `group['value']` and `group['weight']`, respectively.\n\n3. We calculate the weighted average by multiplying the 'value' column with the corresponding 'weight' column using `(values * weights)`, summing the result using `.sum()`, and dividing it by the sum of the weights using `weights.sum()`.\n\n4. We create a sample DataFrame `df` with columns 'category', 'value', and 'weight'.\n\n5. To calculate the weighted average for each category, we use the `groupby` function on the 'category' column and apply the `weighted_average` function to each group using `apply()`.\n\n6. Finally, we print the original DataFrame and the resulting weighted average for each category.\n\nThe output shows the original DataFrame and the weighted average of the 'value' column based on the 'weight' column for each category.\n\nThis code demonstrates how to implement a custom aggregation function to calculate the weighted average using pandas. You can modify the DataFrame and the column names according to your specific use case."
